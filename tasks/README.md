## Total Estimated Effort

- **P0 Tasks**: ~25-30 days
- **P1 Tasks**: ~7-10 days
- **Total**: ~32-40 days

## Getting Started

1. Start with [01-project-setup.md](./01-project-setup.md)
2. Tasks 02 and 03 can be developed in parallel
3. Task 04 is the critical path - most other features depend on it
4. Testing should be ongoing throughout development

## Task Assignment

When picking up a task:
1. Read the full task file
2. Check dependencies are complete
3. Create a feature branch
4. Update task status in this README
5. Submit PR when acceptance criteria are met
