# Task 01: Project Setup and Configuration

## Task Description
Set up the foundational project structure, development environment, and build configuration for the Agent Task Manager application. This includes choosing and configuring the desktop framework (Electron or Tauri), setting up the build system, and establishing the basic project architecture.

## Priority: P0 (Must Have)
## Estimated Effort: 2-3 days

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Desktop framework (Electron/Tauri) selected and configured
- [ ] TypeScript configuration established with strict mode
- [ ] Build system (Vite/Webpack) configured for development and production
- [ ] Hot module replacement working for rapid development
- [ ] Basic application window launches successfully
- [ ] Main/renderer process communication established (if Electron)
- [ ] Development scripts configured in package.json
- [ ] ESLint and Prettier configured with consistent code style
- [ ] Git repository initialized with appropriate .gitignore
- [ ] Basic CI/CD pipeline configuration (GitHub Actions)

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Framework Selection Criteria
- **Electron**: Mature ecosystem, extensive documentation, larger bundle size
- **Tauri**: Smaller bundle size, better performance, Rust backend, newer ecosystem

### Project Structure
```
agent-task-manager/
├── src/
│   ├── main/           # Main process code
│   ├── renderer/       # Renderer/UI code
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   ├── stores/
│   │   ├── utils/
│   │   └── App.tsx
│   └── shared/         # Shared types and utilities
├── assets/
├── tests/
├── scripts/
└── package.json
```

### Key Configuration Files
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration with path aliases
- `vite.config.ts` or `webpack.config.js` - Build configuration
- `.eslintrc.js` - Linting rules
- `.prettierrc` - Code formatting rules
- `electron-builder.yml` or `tauri.conf.json` - App packaging config

### Development Scripts
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "Start development server with hot reload",
    "build": "Build production application",
    "lint": "Run ESLint on source files",
    "format": "Run Prettier on source files",
    "test": "Run test suite",
    "package": "Package application for distribution"
  }
}
```

## Dependencies on Other Tasks
- None (this is the foundational task)

## Subtasks

### 1.1 Framework Evaluation and Selection (4 hours)
- Research Electron vs Tauri capabilities
- Evaluate terminal emulation library compatibility
- Make framework decision based on requirements
- Document decision rationale

### 1.2 Project Initialization (2 hours)
- Initialize project with chosen framework template
- Set up Git repository
- Configure .gitignore for framework-specific files
- Create initial README with setup instructions

### 1.3 TypeScript Configuration (2 hours)
- Configure tsconfig.json with strict mode
- Set up path aliases for clean imports
- Configure separate configs for main/renderer if needed
- Add type definitions for framework APIs

### 1.4 Build System Setup (4 hours)
- Configure Vite or Webpack for the project
- Set up development server with HMR
- Configure production build optimizations
- Ensure proper handling of native modules

### 1.5 Code Quality Tools (3 hours)
- Configure ESLint with TypeScript rules
- Set up Prettier with team preferences
- Configure pre-commit hooks with Husky
- Add lint-staged for efficient linting

### 1.6 Development Environment (3 hours)
- Create development scripts in package.json
- Set up debugging configuration for VS Code
- Configure environment variables handling
- Document development workflow

### 1.7 Basic Application Shell (4 hours)
- Create main process entry point
- Set up basic window management
- Implement renderer process structure
- Verify IPC communication (if Electron)

### 1.8 CI/CD Pipeline (2 hours)
- Set up GitHub Actions workflow
- Configure automated testing on PR
- Add build verification for multiple platforms
- Configure artifact uploads for builds

## Success Metrics
- Development server starts in < 3 seconds
- Hot reload updates in < 1 second
- All linting and formatting rules pass
- Application builds successfully for macOS and Linux
- No TypeScript errors in strict mode

## Risk Mitigation
- **Risk**: Framework limitations discovered late
  - **Mitigation**: Early prototype of terminal embedding
- **Risk**: Build complexity with native modules
  - **Mitigation**: Test terminal library integration early
- **Risk**: Cross-platform compatibility issues
  - **Mitigation**: Set up CI testing on both platforms from start

## Notes
- Consider using a starter template to accelerate setup
- Ensure Node.js version compatibility with chosen framework
- Document all configuration decisions for team onboarding
- Keep bundle size in mind from the beginning
